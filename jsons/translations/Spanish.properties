Mighty Sargon the Great of Akkad, we prostrate ourselves before you! You are the Emperor of the Akkadians, the greatest people to ever arise along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. From its founding around 2300 BCE, Akkad spread its dominion through a force like none of which the ancient world had ever seen, which marked, among other things, history's first standing army. Ranging from the Tarsus Mountsins to the Persian Gulf, the mighty Akkadian empire was a force to be reckoned with. Yet, you were much better than a mere warmonger, because your rule oversaw the flourishing of trade cross all of the Middle East, extending all the way to the cities of Greece. Although the curses of war and famine tore your kingdom apart after centuries of prosperity, Mesopotamia was once again transformed into a land of culture and color as the ever-growing wealth of Akkad heralded a time of peace in the forever restless realm. =

The Muslim empire, the Caliphate was born in the turbulent years after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, as his followers sought to extend the rule of God to all of the people of the earth. The caliphate grew mighty indeed at the height of its power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia. An empire as great as or even greater than that of Rome. The arts and sciences flourished in Arabia during the Middle Ages, even as the countries of Europe descended into ignorance and chaos. The Caliphate survived for six hundred years, until finally succumbing to attack from the Mongols, those destroyers of Empires. =

Salutations, Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the Argentinian nation and wife to Juan Perón. Yours is the second largest country in Latin America, and its name has derived from the rumors of the existence of silver mountains; what is certainly rich is history in both pre-columbian and republican eras. With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat deal with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of their European roots, they deeply linked the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; and because of their condition of colonials, they link themselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies the people, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined. = Saludos, Eva Perón, líder espiritual de la nación argentina y esposa de Juan Perón. El suyo es el segundo país más grande de América Latina, y su nombre deriva de los rumores sobre la existencia de montañas de plata; lo que es ciertamente rico es historia tanto en la época precolombina como en la republicana. Fracturada la primitiva realidad hispanoamericana en la Cuenca del Plata por la inmigración, sus habitantes han llegado a lidiar de algún modo con todos los peligros pero también con todas las ventajas de esa condición: por sus raíces europeas, vincularon profundamente a la nación con los valores perdurables del Viejo Mundo; y por su condición de coloniales, se vinculan con el resto del continente, a través del folklore del interior y del castellano antiguo que unifica al pueblo, sintiendo de algún modo la vocación de la Patria Grande que alguna vez imaginaron San Martín y Bolívar.

Welcome, O magnificent and enlightened King Tiridates III, descendant of the great and ancient Kingship of Armenia. Your country's history stretches far back, its origins tracing from the northernmost satrapies of the mighty Achaemenid Dynasty. For centuries, the Kingdom lay at the crossroads of power, between the two empires of Rome in the West and Parthinia in the East, who would wage bloody war for the right to subjugate her beneath them. In the 3rd century AD, the throne of Armenian Kings would fall to the occupation of the Sassanid Persians, successors of Parthia, but, with the aid of the Roman Emperor Aurelian, it would be restored unto you, Armenia's rightful King. And as her King, you would go on to proclaim Armenia's devotion as the first Christian state in the world, several dozen years prior the proclamation of Constantine the Great. = 
 # Requires translation!
Wise Prince, the Kingdom of Armenia must rise once more, and with it must come the defense of the faith that you would call your own.

Greetings, most wise and prudent Sir Henry Parkes, father of the Australian Federation. Australia truly is a unique and ancient land, more so than any other, for its lands abound in nature's gifts and its shores have beckoned, welcomed, and harbored immigrants from afar for over 50,000 years. By the time you arrived in Sydney as an English immigrant in 1839, Australia was divided into thriving British colonies of undeniably vital significance. By 1889, as premier you had led the colony of New South Wales five times to achieve many great things that undoubtedly improved the lives of many. You will always be remembered, however, in the hearts of Australians, for being instrumental in the process of federating the Australian colonies into a single united nation, earning you the humble title of "The father of the Australian Federation". Thanks to your efforts, Australia today remains one of the most wealthy, prosperous, and modern countries in the developed world, and truly a sight to behold. = Saludos, sabio y prudente Sir Henry Parkes, padre de la Federación Australiana. Australia es realmente una tierra única y antigua, más que ninguna otra, ya que sus tierras abundan en dones de la naturaleza y sus costas han atraído, acogido y albergado a inmigrantes venidos de lejos durante más de 50.000 años. Cuando usted llegó a Sydney como inmigrante inglés en 1839, Australia estaba dividida en prósperas colonias británicas de innegable importancia vital. En 1889, como primer ministro, usted había dirigido la colonia de Nueva Gales del Sur en cinco ocasiones para conseguir grandes logros que, sin duda, mejoraron la vida de muchas personas. Sin embargo, siempre se le recordará en el corazón de los australianos por su papel decisivo en el proceso de federación de las colonias australianas en una única nación unida, lo que le valió el humilde título de "El padre de la Federación Australiana". Gracias a sus esfuerzos, Australia sigue siendo hoy uno de los países más ricos, prósperos y modernos del mundo desarrollado, y un verdadero espectáculo para la vista.
O Henry Parkes, your people call for you in joyful strains once more. Will you make the rest the world hear the thunder of Australia? Will you build a civilization that stands the test of time? = Oh Henry Parkes, tu pueblo te llama con alegres gritos una vez más. ¿Harás que el resto del mundo escuche el trueno de Australia? ¿Construirás una civilización que resista la prueba del tiempo?

Noble and virtuous Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, the people bow to your gracious will. Following the death of your father King Charles VI, you ascended the thone of Austria during a time of great instability, but the empty coffers and diminished military did litle to dissuade your ambitions. Faced with war almost immediately upon your succession to the thron, you managed to fend off your foes, and in naming your husband Francis Stephen co-ruler, assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reigh, you guided Austria on a new path of reform - strengthening the military, replenishing the treasury, and improving the educational system of the kingdom. =

None could stand against you, and your forces became pivotal in driving the Christians out of the Holy Land once more. From your stronghold of Cairo, you established the Ayyubid dynasty, one which would come to rule vast swathes of land, from Tunisia in the west to Mesopotamia in the East and Nubia in the South. Despite your overwhelming military power, you remained chivalrous, for which even your most fervent of enemies respected you. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted long after your death, defeating all those who wished to take her land for centuries before finally succumbing to threats from within. =

Your are the leader of the mighty Aztec people, wandering nomads from a lost home in the north who in the 12th century came to live in the mesa central in the heart of what would come to be call Mexico. Surrounded by many tribes fighting to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texoco, Xaltocan and Zampango. Through cunning alliances and martial prowess, within a mere two hundred years, the Aztecs came to dominate the Central American basin, ruling a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea.

Although conquered by the Kassites and then by the Assyrians, Babylon endured, emerging phoenix-like from its ashes of destruction and regaining its independence despite its many enemies.

Blessings and salutations to you, revered Queen Dido, founder of the legendary kingdom of Carthage. Chronicled by the words of the great poet Virgil, your husband Acerbas was murdered at the hands of your own brother, King Pygmalion of Tyre, who subsequently claimed the treasures of Acerbas that were now rightfully yours. Fearing the lengths from which your brother would pursue this vast wealth, you and your compatriots sailed for new lands. Arriving on the shores of North Africa, you tricked the local king with the simple manipulation of an ox hide, laying out a vast expanse of territory for your new home, the future kingdom of Carthage. =

Hail Alaric, King of the Visigoths, Sacker of Rome! Your people shout your name and raise their swords to you! From the shores of Scandinavia your people came and spread across Europe. In the East, the Ostrogoths successfully revolted against the Huns. In the West, the Visigoths conquered Iberia. Even the eternal city fell before your might in 410 BCE, marking the definitive decline of the Western Roman Empire! Yet, you also possessed the heart and wisdom of a true leader: you forced the senate to free the slaves and treated her citizens with kindness, and paid homage to their gods and let all worship as they might. However - divided, conquered, forgotten - the legacy of the Goths has faded with the passage of time. =

Greetings! = ¡Saludos!
 # Requires translation!
Welcome, Pericles, great statesman of Athens, at which command stands the great Hellenic League! Your people lived for so many years in isolated city-states - legendary cities such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes - where they gave the world many great things, such as democracy, philosophy, ragedy, art and architecture, the very foundation of Western Civilization. Although few in number and often hostile to each other, in the 5th century BC they were able to defeat their much larger neighbor, Persia, on land and sea. =

Oh, great leader, the light Athens and the whole Greece once emanated has waned. The illustrious shine of the grand cities has fallen to ruins, the temples looted and plundered. Your people call out, wishing for someone to take the helm and restore the whole of Greece to her former glory. Will you answer that call, noble Pericles? Will you rise to return Athens, and the rest of the Greek world, to greatness? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

Your men stand proudly to greet you, Great Attila, grand warrior and ruler of the Hunnic empire. Together with your brother Bleda you expanded the boundaries of your empire, becoming the most powerful and frightening force of the 5th century. You bowed the Eastern Roman Emperors to your will and took kingdom after kingdom along the Danube and Nisava Rivers. As the sovereign ruler of the Huns, you marched your army across Europe into Gaul, planning to extend your already impressive lands all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. Your untimely death led to the quick disintegration and downfall of your empire, but your name and deeds have created an everlasting legacy for your people. =

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10'000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, horever, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and thought a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological supeiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! =

Few can boast your patriotism and commitment to the cause of a Free Ireland, Commander Collins. Though you came from the humblest of beginnings, you truly embodied the pride of Irishness. It was not long before you joined the struggle for Home Rule, and you began to build a reputation for yourself – one of dedication, devotion, and pride for Ireland. After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war. And though you paid the ultimate cost in the subsequent civil war, you gave your life for a free state that was established soon after. = Pocos pueden presumir de su patriotismo y compromiso con la causa de una Irlanda Libre, Comandante Collins. Aunque procedía usted de los orígenes más humildes, encarnaba realmente el orgullo de ser irlandés. No tardó en unirse a la lucha por la autonomía y empezó a labrarse una reputación de dedicación, devoción y orgullo por Irlanda. Después de que el Alzamiento de Pascua se volviera sangriento, usted consiguió convertir un movimiento abatido en una potente fuerza física, que lograría fundar una nación irlandesa, librar una guerra por la liberación y conseguir la independencia. Sin embargo, algunos no compartían tu punto de vista y pronto esta nación incompleta volvió a sumirse en la guerra. Y aunque pagaste el precio más alto en la posterior guerra civil, diste tu vida por un Estado libre que se estableció poco después.

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Long have your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario in the land that has come to be known as the New York state in North America. In the mists of antiquity, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida united into one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. With no written language, the wise men of your nation created the great law of peace, the model for many contitutions including that of the United States. For many years, your people battled great enemies, such as the Huron, and the French and English invaders. Tought outnumbered and facing weapons far more advanced than the ones your warriors wielded, the Iroquois survived and prospered, until they were finally overwhelmed by the mighty armies of the new United States. =

Greetings to you, resourceful Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi. You are the founder of the mighty Kilwa Sultanate, a proud people of the sea. You purchased the island which would become your capital for mere cloth after your unlawful ostracism at the hands of your brothers, and built it into a proud city, the envy of the known world. From this new capital, your people, proud traders by nature, travelled the length of the African coast, spreading the influence of your sultanate. The Kilwa are a tolerant people, indeed those cities under your rule feature many separate beliefs, languages and peoples - a venerable melting pot of cultures which together forged the identity of the Swahili people who to this day occupy the lands of your former sultanate. =

Hail to you, brave Nzinga Mbande, Queen of the Ndongo and Matamba, whose beauty is matched only by your cunning. Your Kingdom is part of the great Kingdom of Kongo, situated at the mouth of the mighty Congo River in west-central Africa. You defied tradition by claiming two thrones and are remembered for standing bravely against the onslaught of European imperialism. When the Portuguese invaded your lands, you escaped death and shrewdly manipulated the Dutch into sending you aid. Together you turned back the army of the Portuguese at the Battle of Kombi. Yet, ever faced with threats both inside and out, the never-ending war took its tool, and in the end not even your bravery could stop the march of foreign crowns. = Dios te salve, valiente Nzinga Mbande, Reina de los Ndongo y los Matamba, cuya belleza sólo es igualada por tu astucia. Tu reino forma parte del gran reino de Kongo, situado en la desembocadura del poderoso río Congo, en el centro-oeste de África. Desafiaste la tradición al reclamar dos tronos y se te recuerda por haber resistido con valentía los embates del imperialismo europeo. Cuando los portugueses invadieron tus tierras, escapaste de la muerte y manipulaste astutamente a los holandeses para que te enviaran ayuda. Juntos hicisteis retroceder al ejército portugués en la batalla de Kombi. Sin embargo, siempre enfrentados a amenazas tanto internas como externas, la guerra interminable tomó su herramienta, y al final ni siquiera vuestra valentía pudo detener la marcha de las coronas extranjeras.

Greetings to you, exalted King Sejong the Great, servant to the people and protector of the Choson Dynasty! Your glorious vision of prosperity and overwhelming benevolence towards the common man made you the most beloved of all Korean kings. From the earliest days of your reign, the effort you took to provide a fair and just society for all was surpassed only by the technological advances spurred onwards by your unquenched thirst for knowledge. Guided by your wisdom, the scholars of the Jade Hall developed Korea's first written language, Hangul, bringing the light of literature and science to the masses after centuries of literary darkness. =

Blessings be upon you, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Vytautas the Great. It was your majesty that defeated the Golden Horde, ending forever the Mongol's ambitions about Europe.

The Duchy officially adopted Christianity with the Union of Krewo, signed by your traitorous brother Jogaila in 1386. Despite losing political and cultural solidarity, Lithuania was finally restored to sovereignity in the twentieth century. =

Truly, no empire in East Asia could withstand the might of the Manchu! Your reign is notable for more than sheer conquest, however, with great and important leaps in Manchu culture, such as the funding of the Eight Banners and the creation of a Manchu Alphabet. And your successors would build off your great achievements, conquering the entirety of China and founding one of the greatest dynasties of all time! = Los Ocho Estandartes se inclinan ante ti, ¡oh gran Nurhaci, brillante Khan que beneficia a todas las naciones, unificador de los pueblos manchúes!

Tu reinado fue un periodo de grandes victorias y progreso para el pueblo manchú, consistente en campañas constantemente exitosas contra los Ming, los coreanos, los mongoles y otras tribus jurchen. Verdaderamente, ¡ningún imperio de Asia Oriental pudo resistir el poderío de los manchúes! Sin embargo, su reinado destaca por algo más que la mera conquista, con grandes e importantes saltos en la cultura manchú, como la financiación de los Ocho Estandartes y la creación de un alfabeto manchú. Tus sucesores se basaron en tus grandes logros para conquistar toda China y fundar una de las mayores dinastías de todos los tiempos.
Oh, bold and noble Khan and Chieftain, the empire your actions shaped has fallen, and the Manchu have been reduced to a mere minority group in another nation’s empire. But your people call your name unto the heavens, desperate for your strong and wise leadership to lead them to glory once more! Will you ride with your Bannermen to the field of battle once more? Will you build a civilization to stand the test of time? = Oh, audaz y noble Khan y Cacique, el imperio que tus acciones dieron forma ha caído, y los manchúes han sido reducidos a un mero grupo minoritario en el imperio de otra nación. Pero tu pueblo clama tu nombre a los cielos, ¡desesperado por tu liderazgo fuerte y sabio que les lleve a la gloria una vez más! ¿Volverás a cabalgar con tus Hombres de Banner al campo de batalla? ¿Construirás una civilización que resista el paso del tiempo?

The fertile land itself is ancient and has played host to a myriad of flourishing civilizations - such as the mighty Aztecs, the Maya, the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtecs and the Zapotecs. But it was all changed in the 1500s, when, with power and greed, the Spaniards arrived and began their bloody conquest of the New World. After 300 years of colonization, and having adopted the language, culture and systems of the Spaniards, the people rose up and ousted their former masters. This new, empowered Mexican nation was now the center of attention on the world's stage. The following hundred years were full of ideologies, muralism, foreign invasion and revolution that solidified the feeling of valiant resilience that all Mexicans hold dear to this day. =

Though Cordoba had managed to break away from its Umayyad capital before you took the throne, and all was well within your lands, you were the first to realize Cordoba''s power and potential for prosperity. With your wise governance and skillful funding, you were able to make Cordoba the center of European learning and arts. Yet your wisdom both on and off the battlefield lead to you being named as one of the greatest leaders of the age as well; with your careful hand, you were able to negotiate with your friends and your enemies likewise, making great personal and popular gains. =

Wise Caliph, the reins of power are once more yours! Will you lift them up with great intent and once more steer Cordoba to its peak? Will you help the artists, the soldiers and the students alike? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

Hail stalwart Prince William of Orange, liberator of the Netherlands and hero to the Dutch people. It was your courageous effort in the 1568 rebellion against Spanish dominion that led the Dutch to freedom, and ultimately resulted in the Eighty Years' War.

The blessings of the gods be upon you, Caesar Augustus, emperor of Rome and all her holdings. Your empire was the greatest and longest lived of all in Western civilization. And your people single handedly shaped its culture, law, art, and warfare like none other, before or since. Through years of glorious conquest, Rome came to dominate all the lands of the Mediterranean from Spain in the west to Syria in the east. And her dominion would eventually expand to cover much of England and northern Germany. Roman art and architecture still awe and inspire the world. And she remains the envy of all lesser civilizations who have followed. =

Flower of Scotland = 
King Robert I, legendary monarch and enlightened ruler of Scotland, your realm awaits your command. A bastion of freedom, your nation resisted outside rule for nearly a millennium; bravely fighting off invasion after invasion by even the greatest of empires. Through your cunning and ambition, you succeeded in claiming the throne of Scotland from the very foreigners so despised in your land, who ascended through a series of events only God could foresee. With the throne thus claimed and popular support on your side, you defeated the army of Edward I, the English monarch whom you had previously driven from your lands, and one of the greatest threats your nation had ever faced. It was your actions which established a tenuous peace between your warring Kingdoms, fostering a common history which culminated in the union of the two kingdoms under a Scottish monarch in the year 1707. Yet your legacy is one of ensuring the protection of the culture and freedom of the Scottish people, for which you shall forever be remembered. = Rey Roberto I, monarca legendario y gobernante ilustrado de Escocia, tu reino espera tus órdenes. Bastión de la libertad, tu nación resistió el dominio extranjero durante casi un milenio, luchando valientemente contra una invasión tras otra, incluso de los más grandes imperios. Gracias a tu astucia y ambición, lograste reclamar el trono de Escocia a los propios extranjeros tan despreciados en tu tierra, que ascendieron a través de una serie de acontecimientos que sólo Dios podía prever. Con el trono así reclamado y el apoyo popular de tu lado, derrotaste al ejército de Eduardo I, el monarca inglés al que antes habías expulsado de tus tierras, y una de las mayores amenazas a las que jamás se había enfrentado tu nación. Fueron tus acciones las que establecieron una tenue paz entre tus reinos enfrentados, fomentando una historia común que culminó con la unión de los dos reinos bajo un monarca escocés en el año 1707. Sin embargo, tu legado es el de garantizar la protección de la cultura y la libertad del pueblo escocés, por lo que siempre serás recordado.
Robert the Bruce, general and king, Scotland once more has enemies encroaching on her land. The Scottish people are in need of a great general once more, to send homeward those who would threaten the sovereignty of their Kingdom. Will you fend off all foes that may threaten your nation? Will you ensure that Scotland is the land of the brave and free? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? = Robert the Bruce, general y rey, Escocia vuelve a tener enemigos que invaden sus tierras.

Blessings be upon you, wise and fearsome Chief Pocatello, revered leader of the Shoshone people.

Forced to defend the Shoshone ancestral lands from a seemingly endless stream of new emigrants, your war band struck fear into those who would claim the sacred lands of your people. After years of strife, you skillfully avoided a direct conflict with the armies of the U.S. government, and negotiated a series of treaties in the hopes of establishing a lasting peace for the Shoshone. = Bendito seas, sabio y temible Jefe Pocatello, venerado líder del pueblo Shoshone.

Tras años de lucha, evitaron hábilmente un conflicto directo con los ejércitos del gobierno estadounidense y negociaron una serie de tratados con la esperanza de establecer una paz duradera para los shoshone.
Most esteemed Pocatello, your people once again look to you for guidance. Will you conquer your enemies, driving them far from your lands? Or will you seek out peaceful diplomacy and trade? Will you build a civilization that stands the test of time? = Muy estimado Pocatello, tu pueblo una vez más busca tu guía. ¿Conquistará a sus enemigos, alejándolos de sus tierras? ¿O buscarás la diplomacia pacífica y el comercio? ¿Construirás una civilización que resista el paso del tiempo?

You are the ruler of Siam, an ancient country in the heart of Southeast Asia, a beautiful and mysterious land. Surrounded by foes, beset by bloody war and grinding poverty, the clever and loyal Siamese people have endured and trumphed. King Ramkhamhaeng, your empire was once part of the Khmer Empire, until the 13th century AD, when your ancestors revolted, forming the small Sukhothai kingdom. Through successful battle and cunning diplomacy, the tiny kingdom grew into a mighty empire, an empire which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century! =

With the introduction of the horse, they became fearless warriors, dominating the Great Plains and driving back the Kiowa and Pawnee. Your existance marked the peak of the united tribes led by you, for it crossed the borders of reservation, the symbol of tyranny and humiliation, and defeated the Americans under Little Bighorn, sending a message of liberty and freedom to the world. Alas, your people were fighting a losing battle, for the United States had grown too big, too fast. In just a few short years, even the promised reservations were reduced to mere fractions of their original size, and eventually you yourself fell victim of an assasination at the hands of the white man. Yet, the Sioux legacy survived and your people finally won their rights, inspired by your courage. =

Greetings, most astute Doge Enrico Dandolo of Venice, master of statecraft and shrewd negotiator. Although you rose to power late in life, old age did little to slow your cunning or ambition, as you deftly managed the bustling commercial center of Venice during a time of great instability. In aligning yourself with the Fourth Crusade, you carefully gained a strategic advantage and used the Crusaders to reacquire lost territory for Venice. Your role in guiding the Crusaders during the sacking of Constantinople led to an even greater expansion of your power, and secured your legacy throughout history. = 
 # Requires translation!
Most insightful and cunning Doge, Venice once again requires the service of a skilled leader, one who can bring the republic back to the forefront of world affairs. Can you establish your nation through careful trade, or will you work to conquer your enemies through diplomacy? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =
