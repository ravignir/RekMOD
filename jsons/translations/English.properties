Mighty Sargon the Great of Akkad, we prostrate ourselves before you! You are the Emperor of the Akkadians, the greatest people to ever arise along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. From its founding around 2300 BCE, Akkad spread its dominion through a force like none of which the ancient world had ever seen, which marked, among other things, history's first standing army. Ranging from the Tarsus Mountsins to the Persian Gulf, the mighty Akkadian empire was a force to be reckoned with. Yet, you were much better than a mere warmonger, because your rule oversaw the flourishing of trade cross all of the Middle East, extending all the way to the cities of Greece. Although the curses of war and famine tore your kingdom apart after centuries of prosperity, Mesopotamia was once again transformed into a land of culture and color as the ever-growing wealth of Akkad heralded a time of peace in the forever restless realm. =

Salutations, Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the Argentinian nation and wife to Juan Perón. Yours is the second largest country in Latin America, and its name has derived from the rumors of the existence of silver mountains; what is certainly rich is history in both pre-columbian and republican eras. With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat deal with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of their European roots, they deeply linked the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; and because of their condition of colonials, they link themselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies the people, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined. =

Welcome, O magnificent and enlightened King Tiridates III, descendant of the great and ancient Kingship of Armenia. Your country's history stretches far back, its origins tracing from the northernmost satrapies of the mighty Achaemenid Dynasty. For centuries, the Kingdom lay at the crossroads of power, between the two empires of Rome in the West and Parthinia in the East, who would wage bloody war for the right to subjugate her beneath them. In the 3rd century AD, the throne of Armenian Kings would fall to the occupation of the Sassanid Persians, successors of Parthia, but, with the aid of the Roman Emperor Aurelian, it would be restored unto you, Armenia's rightful King. And as her King, you would go on to proclaim Armenia's devotion as the first Christian state in the world, several dozen years prior the proclamation of Constantine the Great. =

Wise Prince, the Kingdom of Armenia must rise once more, and with it must come the defense of the faith that you would call your own.

Greetings, most wise and prudent Sir Henry Parkes, father of the Australian Federation. Australia truly is a unique and ancient land, more so than any other, for its lands abound in nature's gifts and its shores have beckoned, welcomed, and harbored immigrants from afar for over 50,000 years. By the time you arrived in Sydney as an English immigrant in 1839, Australia was divided into thriving British colonies of undeniably vital significance. By 1889, as premier you had led the colony of New South Wales five times to achieve many great things that undoubtedly improved the lives of many. You will always be remembered, however, in the hearts of Australians, for being instrumental in the process of federating the Australian colonies into a single united nation, earning you the humble title of "The father of the Australian Federation". Thanks to your efforts, Australia today remains one of the most wealthy, prosperous, and modern countries in the developed world, and truly a sight to behold. =

Noble and virtuous Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, the people bow to your gracious will. Following the death of your father King Charles VI, you ascended the thone of Austria during a time of great instability, but the empty coffers and diminished military did litle to dissuade your ambitions. Faced with war almost immediately upon your succession to the thron, you managed to fend off your foes, and in naming your husband Francis Stephen co-ruler, assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reigh, you guided Austria on a new path of reform - strengthening the military, replenishing the treasury, and improving the educational system of the kingdom. =

Peace and blessings be upon you, oh great Saladin! From humble beginnings in a Kurdish family, your upbringing in Damascus saw you excel in all which you took part in. It was under your leadership that combined Muslim armies defeated the ambitious Crusaders of Europe in a series of victories in which you overcame overwhelming odds in order to prevail. None could stand against you, and your forces became pivotal in driving the Christians out of the Holy Land once more. From your stronghold of Cairo, you established the Ayyubid dynasty, one which would come to rule vast swathes of land, from Tunisia in the west to Mesopotamia in the East and Nubia in the South. Despite your overwhelming military power, you remained chivalrous, for which even your most fervent of enemies respected you. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted long after your death, defeating all those who wished to take her land for centuries before finally succumbing to threats from within. =

Oh great Saladin, your people look to you to rebuild the might of the Ayyubid dynasty. Can you once again strike fear into the hearts and minds of your enemies with but a whisper of your name?

Greetings, and may God be with you, President Paul Kruger, leader of the Boer people!

Following the annexation of Transvaal by the British Empire, you lead a resistance movement, leading to the First Boer War. The Boers proved victorious, your skillful negotiations securing Transvaal's independence under British suzerainty. Elected President of the newly-united South African Republic four times, your bold diplomacy and characteristic image cemented Boer culture in Africa, and in history! =

O' King Anawrahta, founder of the Pagan Empire, your people bow before you. Since her establishment and flourishing in the Irrawaddy Delta, Burma has continuously astounded the world with both her strength and her culture; the lesser nations around her trembled before the might of her armies and gazed in awe upon the beauty of her architecture. You, who embraced Buddhism, stopped the might of the Khmer empire and made great efforts to turn the lands of central Burma into rice granaries, which formed the enduring economic base for centuries. All this allowed the Burmese to eventually form one of the largest and most cultured empires in the history of Southeast Asia, leaving a legacy both profound and glorious. =

Great Anawrahta, legendary Father of the Burmese Nation, your people look to you to bring forth a new prosperous age for your nation! Will you restore your empire to her former splendour? Will you once again lead your armies to victory? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

All hail the most magnificent and magnanimous Empress Theodora, beloved of Byzantium and of Rome! From the lowly ranks of actress and courtesan you became the most powerful woman in the Roman Empire, consort to Justinian I. Starting in the late 520's AD, you joined your husband in a series of important spiritual and legal reforms, creating many laws which elevated the status of and promoted equal treatment of women in the empire. You also aided in the restoration and construction of many aqueducts, bridges and churches across Constantinople, culminating in the creation of the Hagia Sophia, one of the most splendid architectural wonders of the world. =

Beautiful Empress, Byzantium is in need of your wisdom and strength - her people are lost without your light to lead them.

Hail to you, O' Great Captain, General, and Admiral, Bernardo O'Higgens Riquelme, father of the Chilean nation. With tenacity and skill, you led the nascent Chile to its liberty. Propelled by Napoleon's conquest of Spain and inspired by the ideals sweeping across the new world, your role in Chile's independence war would see you rise to the position of Supreme Director. In this position, you would proclaim an independent republic, and in so doing would fuel the flames of Latin independence. =

Blessings and salutations to you, revered Queen Dido, founder of the legendary kingdom of Carthage.

Fearing the lengths from which your brother would pursue this vast wealth, you and your compatriots sailed for new lands. Arriving on the shores of North Africa, you tricked the local king with the simple manipulation of an ox hide, laying out a vast expanse of territory for your new home, the future kingdom of Carthage. = 
 # Requires translation!
Clever and inquisitive Dido, the world longs for a leader who can provide a shelter from the coming storm, guided by brilliant intuition and cunning. Can you lead the people in the creation of a new kingdom to rival that of once mighty Carthage? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

Although much more of a conqueror than an economic or social reformer, you have always helped the poor and sick in your kingdom. Despite being unable to write well yourself, you had a vast love of literature and education. Due to your conquests contacts with many different cultures and learning institutions, your era is became known as the Carolingian Renaissance, with a blossoming of the arts and sciences. =

Hail Alaric, King of the Visigoths, Sacker of Rome! Your people shout your name and raise their swords to you! From the shores of Scandinavia your people came and spread across Europe. In the East, the Ostrogoths successfully revolted against the Huns. In the West, the Visigoths conquered Iberia. Even the eternal city fell before your might in 410 BCE, marking the definitive decline of the Western Roman Empire! Yet, you also possessed the heart and wisdom of a true leader: you forced the senate to free the slaves and treated her citizens with kindness, and paid homage to their gods and let all worship as they might. However - divided, conquered, forgotten - the legacy of the Goths has faded with the passage of time. =

Greetings, President Mahatma Gandhi, great souled leader of India! You are the ruler of one of the oldest countries in the world with history stretching back almost 10'000 years. A spiritual country, India is the birthplace of three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. This is a passionate land of music and color, a land of great wealth and grinding poverty. For centuries, India was divided into kingdoms who fought constantly with each other and against outside invaders. That was, horever, after empires such as Maratha, Maurya and Gupta. In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and thought a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological supeiority, they conquered your fragmented nation. England remained in power for some two centuries until driven out by a rising wave of Indian nationalism, a peaceful rebellion unlike any before seen in history, one led by you! =

Few can boast your patriotism and commitment to the cause of a Free Ireland, Commander Collins. Though you came from the humblest of beginnings, you truly embodied the pride of Irishness. It was not long before you joined the struggle for Home Rule, and you began to build a reputation for yourself – one of dedication, devotion, and pride for Ireland. After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war. And though you paid the ultimate cost in the subsequent civil war, you gave your life for a free state that was established soon after. =

For many years, your people battled great enemies, such as the Huron, and the French and English invaders.

You innovated the arts and architecture of the empire, and even gave the order to build the legendary Angkor Wat, the largest temple in the known world!

Greetings to you, resourceful Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi. You are the founder of the mighty Kilwa Sultanate, a proud people of the sea. You purchased the island which would become your capital for mere cloth after your unlawful ostracism at the hands of your brothers, and built it into a proud city, the envy of the known world. From this new capital, your people, proud traders by nature, travelled the length of the African coast, spreading the influence of your sultanate. The Kilwa are a tolerant people, indeed those cities under your rule feature many separate beliefs, languages and peoples - a venerable melting pot of cultures which together forged the identity of the Swahili people who to this day occupy the lands of your former sultanate. = 
 # Requires translation!
The empire lasted long after your death, with your descendants ruling for many more centuries, expanding the rule of the Kilwa Sultanate far and wide, falling only to an invasion of superior weaponry at the hands of European colonials. Yet none could compare to you, wise leader. Your people call for you to lead them to greatness across the seas. Will you answer their call? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =

You defied tradition by claiming two thrones and are remembered for standing bravely against the onslaught of European imperialism. When the Portuguese invaded your lands, you escaped death and shrewdly manipulated the Dutch into sending you aid. Together you turned back the army of the Portuguese at the Battle of Kombi. Yet, ever faced with threats both inside and out, the never-ending war took its tool, and in the end not even your bravery could stop the march of foreign crowns. =

The Duchy officially adopted Christianity with the Union of Krewo, signed by your traitorous brother Jogaila in 1386. Despite losing political and cultural solidarity, Lithuania was finally restored to sovereignity in the twentieth century. =

Since Chandragupta, the Mauryan dynasty has established internal and external trade, agriculture and economic activities, all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. In the merciless battle, you have defeated the state of Kalinga, the last opponent on the Indian subcontinent. You have brought peace, entering an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. The population of the empire has been estimated to be about 50 – 60 million, making the Mauryan Empire one of the most populous empires of Antiquity, a splendor worthy of rivaling the Roman Empire and the Han Dynasty in China. =

Your people greet you with a thunderous applause, oh Benito Juárez, overthrower of an empire and leader of the esteemed Mexican Republic! Mexico has a rich history, for its culture is nearly as diverse as its people are. The fertile land itself is ancient and has played host to a myriad of flourishing civilizations - such as the mighty Aztecs, the Maya, the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtecs and the Zapotecs. But it was all changed in the 1500s, when, with power and greed, the Spaniards arrived and began their bloody conquest of the New World. After 300 years of colonization, and having adopted the language, culture and systems of the Spaniards, the people rose up and ousted their former masters. This new, empowered Mexican nation was now the center of attention on the world's stage. The following hundred years were full of ideologies, muralism, foreign invasion and revolution that solidified the feeling of valiant resilience that all Mexicans hold dear to this day. =

Noble Benito Juárez, from humble beginnings as a Zapotec native, you rose to lead this great country. It was you that resisted the French and restored the republic.

Blessings of God be upon you, oh Great Emperor Suleiman! Your power, wealth and generosity awe the world! Truly, are you called 'Magnificent!' Your empire began in Bithynia, a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century. Taking advantage in the decline of the great Selkuj Sultanate of Rum, King Osman I of Bithynia expanded west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your subjects brought down the empire of Byzantium, taking its holdings in Turkey and then the Balkans. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans captured ancient Constantinople, gaining control of the strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. Your people's empire would continue to expand for centuries governing much of North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height. =

King Robert I, legendary monarch and enlightened ruler of Scotland, your realm awaits your command. A bastion of freedom, your nation resisted outside rule for nearly a millennium; bravely fighting off invasion after invasion by even the greatest of empires. Through your cunning and ambition, you succeeded in claiming the throne of Scotland from the very foreigners so despised in your land, who ascended through a series of events only God could foresee. With the throne thus claimed and popular support on your side, you defeated the army of Edward I, the English monarch whom you had previously driven from your lands, and one of the greatest threats your nation had ever faced. It was your actions which established a tenuous peace between your warring Kingdoms, fostering a common history which culminated in the union of the two kingdoms under a Scottish monarch in the year 1707. Yet your legacy is one of ensuring the protection of the culture and freedom of the Scottish people, for which you shall forever be remembered. =

Robert the Bruce, general and king, Scotland once more has enemies encroaching on her land.

Forced to defend the Shoshone ancestral lands from a seemingly endless stream of new emigrants, your war band struck fear into those who would claim the sacred lands of your people. After years of strife, you skillfully avoided a direct conflict with the armies of the U.S. government, and negotiated a series of treaties in the hopes of establishing a lasting peace for the Shoshone. =

Proud Sitting Bull, Chief of the Hunkpapa Lakota, the Seven Council Fires gather to listen and honour your wisdom.

With the introduction of the horse, they became fearless warriors, dominating the Great Plains and driving back the Kiowa and Pawnee. Your existance marked the peak of the united tribes led by you, for it crossed the borders of reservation, the symbol of tyranny and humiliation, and defeated the Americans under Little Bighorn, sending a message of liberty and freedom to the world. Alas, your people were fighting a losing battle, for the United States had grown too big, too fast. In just a few short years, even the promised reservations were reduced to mere fractions of their original size, and eventually you yourself fell victim of an assasination at the hands of the white man. Yet, the Sioux legacy survived and your people finally won their rights, inspired by your courage. =

Greetings, most astute Doge Enrico Dandolo of Venice, master of statecraft and shrewd negotiator. Although you rose to power late in life, old age did little to slow your cunning or ambition, as you deftly managed the bustling commercial center of Venice during a time of great instability. In aligning yourself with the Fourth Crusade, you carefully gained a strategic advantage and used the Crusaders to reacquire lost territory for Venice. Your role in guiding the Crusaders during the sacking of Constantinople led to an even greater expansion of your power, and secured your legacy throughout history. = 
 # Requires translation!
Most insightful and cunning Doge, Venice once again requires the service of a skilled leader, one who can bring the republic back to the forefront of world affairs. Can you establish your nation through careful trade, or will you work to conquer your enemies through diplomacy? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? =
