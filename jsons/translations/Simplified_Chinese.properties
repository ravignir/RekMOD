Mighty Sargon the Great of Akkad, we prostrate ourselves before you! You are the Emperor of the Akkadians, the greatest people to ever arise along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. From its founding around 2300 BCE, Akkad spread its dominion through a force like none of which the ancient world had ever seen, which marked, among other things, history's first standing army. Ranging from the Tarsus Mountsins to the Persian Gulf, the mighty Akkadian empire was a force to be reckoned with. Yet, you were much better than a mere warmonger, because your rule oversaw the flourishing of trade cross all of the Middle East, extending all the way to the cities of Greece. Although the curses of war and famine tore your kingdom apart after centuries of prosperity, Mesopotamia was once again transformed into a land of culture and color as the ever-growing wealth of Akkad heralded a time of peace in the forever restless realm. =

Salutations, Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the Argentinian nation and wife to Juan Perón. Yours is the second largest country in Latin America, and its name has derived from the rumors of the existence of silver mountains; what is certainly rich is history in both pre-columbian and republican eras. With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat deal with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of their European roots, they deeply linked the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; and because of their condition of colonials, they link themselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies the people, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined. = 向阿根廷民族的精神领袖、胡安-庇隆的妻子伊娃-庇隆致敬。阿根廷是拉丁美洲第二大国，其国名源于关于银山存在的传言；无论是前哥伦比亚时代还是共和时代，阿根廷的历史无疑都是丰富多彩的。由于移民问题，拉普拉塔盆地的原始西语美洲现实支离破碎，这里的居民在某种程度上面临着所有的危险，但也拥有这种状况的所有优势：由于他们的欧洲血统，他们将国家与旧世界的持久价值观深深地联系在一起；由于他们的殖民地状况，他们通过内陆的民间传说和将人民团结在一起的古老卡斯蒂利亚语，将自己与拉美大陆的其他地区联系在一起，在某种程度上感受到圣马丁和玻利瓦尔曾经想象过的 "大祖国 "的使命。
Evita, your people still remember your deeds to the people in the darkest times, because you defended the rights of Descamisados and Women in your great nation. Now it falls to you to build a nation of hope and justice for everyone. Will you answer the call? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? = 艾薇塔，你的人民仍然记得你在最黑暗的时期为人民所做的一切，因为你捍卫了你伟大祖国的笛卡米萨多人和妇女的权利。现在，为所有人建立一个充满希望和正义的国家的重任落在了你的肩上。你们会响应号召吗？你们能建立一个经得起时间考验的文明吗？

Welcome, O magnificent and enlightened King Tiridates III, descendant of the great and ancient Kingship of Armenia. Your country's history stretches far back, its origins tracing from the northernmost satrapies of the mighty Achaemenid Dynasty. For centuries, the Kingdom lay at the crossroads of power, between the two empires of Rome in the West and Parthinia in the East, who would wage bloody war for the right to subjugate her beneath them. In the 3rd century AD, the throne of Armenian Kings would fall to the occupation of the Sassanid Persians, successors of Parthia, but, with the aid of the Roman Emperor Aurelian, it would be restored unto you, Armenia's rightful King. And as her King, you would go on to proclaim Armenia's devotion as the first Christian state in the world, several dozen years prior the proclamation of Constantine the Great. =

Greetings, most wise and prudent Sir Henry Parkes, father of the Australian Federation. Australia truly is a unique and ancient land, more so than any other, for its lands abound in nature's gifts and its shores have beckoned, welcomed, and harbored immigrants from afar for over 50,000 years. By the time you arrived in Sydney as an English immigrant in 1839, Australia was divided into thriving British colonies of undeniably vital significance. By 1889, as premier you had led the colony of New South Wales five times to achieve many great things that undoubtedly improved the lives of many. You will always be remembered, however, in the hearts of Australians, for being instrumental in the process of federating the Australian colonies into a single united nation, earning you the humble title of "The father of the Australian Federation". Thanks to your efforts, Australia today remains one of the most wealthy, prosperous, and modern countries in the developed world, and truly a sight to behold. = 澳大利亚联邦之父、最睿智、最谨慎的亨利-帕克斯爵士，您好。澳大利亚确实是一片独特而古老的土地，比任何其他国家都更加独特，因为它的土地上充满了大自然的馈赠，它的海岸在五万多年的时间里一直在召唤、欢迎和庇护着来自远方的移民。1839 年，当您作为英国移民抵达悉尼时，澳大利亚已被划分为繁荣的英国殖民地，其重要意义毋庸置疑。到 1889 年，您作为总理五次领导新南威尔士殖民地取得了许多伟大成就，无疑改善了许多人的生活。然而，在澳大利亚人心中，您将永远被铭记，因为您在将澳大利亚各殖民地合并成一个统一国家的过程中发挥了重要作用，并因此获得了 "澳大利亚联邦之父 "的谦逊称号。在您的努力下，今天的澳大利亚仍然是发达国家中最富裕、最繁荣、最现代化的国家之一，确实令人刮目相看。

Noble and virtuous Queen Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Austria, the people bow to your gracious will. Following the death of your father King Charles VI, you ascended the thone of Austria during a time of great instability, but the empty coffers and diminished military did litle to dissuade your ambitions. Faced with war almost immediately upon your succession to the thron, you managed to fend off your foes, and in naming your husband Francis Stephen co-ruler, assured your place as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. During your reigh, you guided Austria on a new path of reform - strengthening the military, replenishing the treasury, and improving the educational system of the kingdom. =

Peace and blessings be upon you, oh great Saladin! From humble beginnings in a Kurdish family, your upbringing in Damascus saw you excel in all which you took part in. It was under your leadership that combined Muslim armies defeated the ambitious Crusaders of Europe in a series of victories in which you overcame overwhelming odds in order to prevail. None could stand against you, and your forces became pivotal in driving the Christians out of the Holy Land once more. From your stronghold of Cairo, you established the Ayyubid dynasty, one which would come to rule vast swathes of land, from Tunisia in the west to Mesopotamia in the East and Nubia in the South. Despite your overwhelming military power, you remained chivalrous, for which even your most fervent of enemies respected you. The Ayyubid dynasty lasted long after your death, defeating all those who wished to take her land for centuries before finally succumbing to threats from within. =

Through cunning alliances and martial prowess, within a mere two hundred years, the Aztecs came to dominate the Central American basin, ruling a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea.

Hail Alaric, King of the Visigoths, Sacker of Rome! Your people shout your name and raise their swords to you! From the shores of Scandinavia your people came and spread across Europe.

Even the eternal city fell before your might in 410 BCE, marking the definitive decline of the Western Roman Empire! Yet, you also possessed the heart and wisdom of a true leader: you forced the senate to free the slaves and treated her citizens with kindness, and paid homage to their gods and let all worship as they might. However - divided, conquered, forgotten - the legacy of the Goths has faded with the passage of time. =

In the 12th century AD, India was conquered by Muslim Turks fled from the Mongols. In the early 17th century, the English arrived, and thought a combination of shrewd diplomacy and technological supeiority, they conquered your fragmented nation.

Serving your queen and empire with loyalty, you not only strive to fulfill your oath and conquered any who stood in your path, but you succeeded in capturing what was then the entirety of the known archipelago, the first to unite what is today modern Indonesia. = 荣誉与你同在，哦，伟大的英雄加查马达，满者伯夷领袖和印度尼西亚群岛的统一者。你们在战场上的英雄主义故事，只有你们宣誓将印度尼西亚遥远的岛屿团结在一个旗帜下的传说才能胜过。忠诚地为你的女王和帝国服务，你不仅努力履行你的誓言并征服任何挡在你路上的人，而且你第一个成功地占领了当时整个已知群岛。
Mighty warrior Gajah Mada, your people yearn for a strong leader who can return them to prosperity! Will you set out to conquer the neighboring kingdoms, further expanding your glory of your empire? Will you build a civilization that can stand the test of time? = 强大的战士加查马达，你的人民渴望一个强大的领袖，可以让他们恢复繁荣！你会开始征服邻近的王国，进一步扩大你帝国的荣耀吗？你会建立一个经得起时间考验的文明吗?

Few can boast your patriotism and commitment to the cause of a Free Ireland, Commander Collins. Though you came from the humblest of beginnings, you truly embodied the pride of Irishness. It was not long before you joined the struggle for Home Rule, and you began to build a reputation for yourself – one of dedication, devotion, and pride for Ireland. After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war. And though you paid the ultimate cost in the subsequent civil war, you gave your life for a free state that was established soon after. = 科林斯司令，很少有人能像您一样，以爱国主义精神和对自由爱尔兰事业的献身精神而自豪。虽然您出身卑微，但您真正体现了爱尔兰人的骄傲。不久，您就加入了争取地方自治的斗争，并开始为自己赢得声誉--一个为爱尔兰献身、奉献和自豪的人。复活节起义血流成河之后，你成功地将一场被打倒的运动变成了一股强大的有形力量，这股力量将成功地建立爱尔兰国家、进行解放战争并赢得独立。然而，有些人并不赞同你们的观点，很快，这个不完整的国家再次陷入战争。虽然你们在随后的内战中付出了最终的代价，但你们为不久后建立的自由国家献出了生命。
Michael Collins, Ireland looks up to you again for guidance in a new time of hardship. Will you serve once more for your nation and your people? Will you overcome those that seek to shackle you? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? = 迈克尔-柯林斯，在新的艰难时刻，爱尔兰再次期待您的指引。你会再次为你的国家和人民服务吗？你能否战胜那些试图束缚你的人呢？你能建立一个经得起时间考验的文明吗？

Greetings, noble Hiawatha, leader of the mighty Iroquois nations! Long have your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario in the land that has come to be known as the New York state in North America. In the mists of antiquity, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida united into one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois. With no written language, the wise men of your nation created the great law of peace, the model for many contitutions including that of the United States. For many years, your people battled great enemies, such as the Huron, and the French and English invaders. Tought outnumbered and facing weapons far more advanced than the ones your warriors wielded, the Iroquois survived and prospered, until they were finally overwhelmed by the mighty armies of the new United States. =

But though victorious, Italy's losses would be too great, and the road would for paved for the country's next great threat: Benito Mussolini and his fascism. Luckily, his shadow that loomed upon you and your beautiful nation would not last forever, and soon you indirectly paved the way for a new Italy, one that would seek cooperation with its neighbours instead of competition driven by the culture of the Rinascimento of many centuries ago. =

Greetings to you, resourceful Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi. You are the founder of the mighty Kilwa Sultanate, a proud people of the sea. You purchased the island which would become your capital for mere cloth after your unlawful ostracism at the hands of your brothers, and built it into a proud city, the envy of the known world. From this new capital, your people, proud traders by nature, travelled the length of the African coast, spreading the influence of your sultanate. The Kilwa are a tolerant people, indeed those cities under your rule feature many separate beliefs, languages and peoples - a venerable melting pot of cultures which together forged the identity of the Swahili people who to this day occupy the lands of your former sultanate. =

The empire lasted long after your death, with your descendants ruling for many more centuries, expanding the rule of the Kilwa Sultanate far and wide, falling only to an invasion of superior weaponry at the hands of European colonials.

Truly, no empire in East Asia could withstand the might of the Manchu! Your reign is notable for more than sheer conquest, however, with great and important leaps in Manchu culture, such as the funding of the Eight Banners and the creation of a Manchu Alphabet. And your successors would build off your great achievements, conquering the entirety of China and founding one of the greatest dynasties of all time! = 伟大的努尔哈赤啊，造福万民的辉煌大汗，满族人民的统一者，八旗向您鞠躬致敬！在您的统治下，分散的女真部落统一成为一个伟大的帝国！您在位期间，满族人民取得了巨大的胜利和进步，对明朝、朝鲜、蒙古和其他女真部落的战争不断取得胜利。事实上，东亚没有一个帝国能够抵挡满清的强大！然而，您在位期间所取得的成就远不止征服这么简单，满族文化也取得了巨大而重要的飞跃，如资助八旗和创建满文字母表。您的继任者将在您的伟大成就基础上再接再厉，征服整个中国，建立有史以来最伟大的王朝之一！
Oh, bold and noble Khan and Chieftain, the empire your actions shaped has fallen, and the Manchu have been reduced to a mere minority group in another nation’s empire.

Your people greet you with a thunderous applause, oh Benito Juárez, overthrower of an empire and leader of the esteemed Mexican Republic! Mexico has a rich history, for its culture is nearly as diverse as its people are. The fertile land itself is ancient and has played host to a myriad of flourishing civilizations - such as the mighty Aztecs, the Maya, the Olmecs, Toltecs, Mixtecs and the Zapotecs. But it was all changed in the 1500s, when, with power and greed, the Spaniards arrived and began their bloody conquest of the New World. After 300 years of colonization, and having adopted the language, culture and systems of the Spaniards, the people rose up and ousted their former masters. This new, empowered Mexican nation was now the center of attention on the world's stage. The following hundred years were full of ideologies, muralism, foreign invasion and revolution that solidified the feeling of valiant resilience that all Mexicans hold dear to this day. =

Blessings of God be upon you, oh Great Emperor Suleiman! Your power, wealth and generosity awe the world! Truly, are you called 'Magnificent!' Your empire began in Bithynia, a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century. Taking advantage in the decline of the great Selkuj Sultanate of Rum, King Osman I of Bithynia expanded west into Anatolia. Over the next century, your subjects brought down the empire of Byzantium, taking its holdings in Turkey and then the Balkans. In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans captured ancient Constantinople, gaining control of the strategic link between Europe and the Middle East. Your people's empire would continue to expand for centuries governing much of North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height. =

The blessings of heaven be upon you, beloved king Darius of Persia! You lead a strong and wise people. In the morning of the world, the great Persian leader Cyrus revolted against the mighty Median empire and by 550 BC, the Medes were no more. Through cunning diplomacy and military prowess, great Cyrus conquered wealthy Lydia and powerful Babylon. His son conquering proud Egypt some years later.

It was your actions which established a tenuous peace between your warring Kingdoms, fostering a common history which culminated in the union of the two kingdoms under a Scottish monarch in the year 1707. Yet your legacy is one of ensuring the protection of the culture and freedom of the Scottish people, for which you shall forever be remembered. = 罗伯特一世国王，苏格兰传奇的君主和开明的统治者，您的王国正等待着您的号令。作为自由的堡垒，您的国家抵御外来统治近千年，勇敢地抵御了最强大帝国的一次又一次入侵。通过你的狡猾和野心，你成功地从你的国家如此蔑视的外国人手中夺得了苏格兰的王位，他是通过一系列只有上帝才能预见的事件登上王位的。凭借您的王位和民众的支持，您击败了爱德华一世的军队，爱德华一世是英国君主，您曾将他从您的土地上赶走，他也是您的国家所面临的最大威胁之一。正是您的行动在交战王国之间建立了脆弱的和平，促进了共同的历史，最终两个王国于 1707 年在苏格兰君主的领导下合并。然而，您留下的遗产是确保苏格兰人民的文化和自由得到保护，您将因此被永远铭记。

With the introduction of the horse, they became fearless warriors, dominating the Great Plains and driving back the Kiowa and Pawnee. Your existance marked the peak of the united tribes led by you, for it crossed the borders of reservation, the symbol of tyranny and humiliation, and defeated the Americans under Little Bighorn, sending a message of liberty and freedom to the world. Alas, your people were fighting a losing battle, for the United States had grown too big, too fast. In just a few short years, even the promised reservations were reduced to mere fractions of their original size, and eventually you yourself fell victim of an assasination at the hands of the white man. Yet, the Sioux legacy survived and your people finally won their rights, inspired by your courage. =

Ultimately, his conquest of the wealthy cities of Timbuktu and Jenne gave the growing Songhai empire the economic power to survive for some 100 years, until the empire was destroyed by foes with advanced technology - muskets against spearmen. =

Greetings, most astute Doge Enrico Dandolo of Venice, master of statecraft and shrewd negotiator. Although you rose to power late in life, old age did little to slow your cunning or ambition, as you deftly managed the bustling commercial center of Venice during a time of great instability. In aligning yourself with the Fourth Crusade, you carefully gained a strategic advantage and used the Crusaders to reacquire lost territory for Venice. Your role in guiding the Crusaders during the sacking of Constantinople led to an even greater expansion of your power, and secured your legacy throughout history. = 问候，威尼斯最精明的总督恩里科·丹多洛，治国大师和精明的谈判者。虽然你上台时已经迟暮，但老年并没有减缓你的狡猾或野心，因为你在一个非常不稳定的时期巧妙地管理了威尼斯繁华的商业中心。在与第四次十字军东征结盟的过程中，你小心翼翼地获得了战略优势，并利用十字军为威尼斯夺回了失地。你在洗劫期间作为指导十字军的角色，获得了无数财富。
Most insightful and cunning Doge, Venice once again requires the service of a skilled leader, one who can bring the republic back to the forefront of world affairs. Can you establish your nation through careful trade, or will you work to conquer your enemies through diplomacy? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? = 威尼斯最有见地和狡猾的总督再次需要一个熟练的领导人的服务，一个能够将共和国带回世界事务前沿的人。你能通过谨慎的贸易建立你的国家，还是通过外交来征服你的敌人？你能建立一个经得起时间考验的文明吗?
